## Adventures in Mega Drive coding

_Please note: These are only experiments, I'm not a M68K assembly pro!_

"On my journey from buying a Mega Drive 1991 to starting to learn assembly for the Motorola 68000 around 2020 I always felt that I wanted to do this. God knows why it took so long.

This repository is intended to be filled with commented code for Mega Drive enthusiasts. Following the path of great tutors I want to give something back because I appreciate the time and effort they took to teach n00bs like me about how to write code, use debuggers and disassemblers, understanding the hardware and have a real good time with an old friend - the Sega Mega Drive."
